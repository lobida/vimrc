========== MFA ==========
pbcopy in tmux issue:
brew install reattach-to-user-namespace

To install it on MAC, run “brew install oath-toolkit” assuming you have brew installed already.
To use it to generate MFA code, run something like: “oathtool --totp --base32 <your_secret_key>”
On MAC, you can go further and copy the MFA code to clipboard instead of print it on screen by pipeline it to pbcopy: “oathtool --totp --base32 <your_secret_key> | pbcopy”

========== pbcopy for linux  ==========
if you have X installed you may try xsel in this way :

alias pbcopy='xsel --clipboard --input'
alias pbpaste='xsel --clipboard --output'
or with xclip :

alias pbcopy='xclip -selection clipboard'
alias pbpaste='xclip -selection clipboard -o'
now you can use'em :

echo 'go to my clipboard' | pbcopy
when I don't have X I use GNU Screen functionality to copy between open shells in a session using keyboard

to copy : Ctrl-a -> Esc -> go to wanted position * -> Space (to begin selecting) -> press k to go forward mark text -> Enter

to paste : Ctrl-a + ]

* movements are done with vim like key bindings (j, k, l & m).
